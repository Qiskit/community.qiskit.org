## What is a Qiskit Research Unconference?

Qiskit Research Unconferences are participant-driven events that catalyze group research projects. The event forms around the ideas and work of the participants, with an emphasis on collaboration and motivation. 

At a Qiskit Research Unconference attendees can collaborate with both quantum researchers and the Qiskit core development team.

The 2020 Qiskit Research Unconference will be hosted in Lapland, Findland from 25–29 of March. Invitations will be distributed prior to the event.

Attendees that are new to Qiskit or want to learn more about current research applications of the open-source software should attend the optional seminars at Aalto University on March 24 immediately preceding the Unconference. 

## Location

The  2020 Qiskit Research Unconference will take place at the Star Arctic Hotel (https://stararctichotel.com/). The Star Arctic Hotel is located in Saariselkä, Finland, and is a gateway to the trails and ski areas of mountainous Urho Kekkonen National Park.
