## What is Qiskit Camp?

Qiskit Camps are an immersive experience that consists of training sessions, deep technical talks, and a hackathon alongside the Qiskit core development team. At Qiskit Camp, attendees can collaborate with both quantum researchers and computer scientists to connect with the larger global quantum community.

2019 Qiskit Camp Africa will be hosted near Johannesberg, South Africa from 11-14 December. Invitations will be distributed prior to the event.

Attendees that are new to Qiskit, or simply want to increase their proficiency in quantum computing should attend the week-long [Quantum Computing Summer School](http://www.wits.ac.za/quantum-computing/summer-school/) at Wits University from December 2-11 immediately preceding Qiskit Camp.

## Location

Qiskit Camp Africa will take place at the Kwa Maritane Bush Lodge (https://www.legacyhotels.co.za/hotels/kwa-maritane-bush-lodge). The Kwa Maritane is located in the Pilanesberg National Park on the slopes of a 2-billion-year-old volcano, and is a wildlife refuge.
