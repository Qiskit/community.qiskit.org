Automation of the quantum circuit building process by using reinforcement learning and validating the method by performing simple numerical experiments on a Bell State.

Making quantum circuits is a hard task, even for specific use cases on simple operations, the composing mechanism isnâ€™t very intuitive and usually some extensive research and try/error needs to be done.

With this approach, based on an input we know and an output we want, a neural network will start trying random combinations with reinforcement learning until the circuit is optimized and reduced to minimum amount of gates.
