<p>Qiskit Camps are an immersive experience that consists of training sessions, deep technical talks, and a hackathon alongside the Qiskit core development team. At Qiskit Camp, attendees can collaborate with both quantum researchers and computer scientists to connect with the larger global quantum community.</p>
<p>2019 Qiskit Camp Europe will be hosted near Zürich, Switzerland from 12–15 September. Invitations will be distributed prior to the event.</p>
<p>Attendees that are new to Qiskit, or simply want to increase their proficiency in quantum computing, should attend <a href="https://qid.ethz.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squid</a>'s one week summer school from 8–12 September 2019 at ETH Zürich.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
